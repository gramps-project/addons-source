Introduction
============
the "Descendant Books" plugin consists of two book type plugins. Descendant Book
and Detailed Descendant Book. Both reports are based directly of Descendant
Report and Detailed Descendant Report, the main difference being instead of just
producung a report based of the Center Person, it allows for the use of a built
in Query or Custom query. This idea is to produce as many descendant reports as
is required to satisfy inclusion of all individuals within the given query.

If for instance "Entire Database" is chosen as the query to use. Then the entire
database is traversed and a unique list of ancestors is determined and then a
descendant report for each of these ancestors is produced.

As there is a potential to produce more than one report the best place to
include these reports is under Books. If more than one report is produced a
table of contents is generated to show how reports there are.

To date my most common uses are :
 - Entire Database
   I find that running of either report using the Entire database is really
   useful for highlighting potential people in my database that I've not linked
   up, dangling tree elements etc.

 - Ancestors of <Person>
   Again really useful to get a complete accurate picture of the entire family
   tree of an individual, pretty much includes all cousins of this person. Up
   to now to print this you would first have to determine all the possible
   ancestors of this person, and then manually generate a descendant report
   for each of these ancesotrs. By running this report we get all these reports
   generated in one go and a table of contents to boot !!

Descendant Report Differences:
==============================
Most of these specific differences I would hope end up in Trunk/Core as such
there are bug/feature requets logged for each one.  If the bugs are marked
resolved then they've been integrated and you can ignore the refernece here. or
Just ping me to remove the reference. Other changes like the suppression of
duplicates really only apply when there are more than one report being printed
as such are unique to these plugins.

- Descendant Report:
  If a family is encounted in one report that has already been printed in a
  previous report then only a reference is printed for this family of the
  location in the previous report where this resides. This saves on showing the
  exact same list of descendants more than once (saves paper as well)

- Detailed Descendant Report:
  - Similar to Descendant report, the supression of printing of duplicate
    people is achieved here as well except for each person encounted a
    reference back to the original is shown kind of similar to the existing
    functionality around printing "Same as person..."

  - A new section is also shown for each person, showing a reference to each
    report this person appears in.

TODO
====
- Addition of a title page.
- Somehow being able to print page numbers in the table of contents.
  If this was possible then possible including page numbers in report 
  references as well. Only really useful when generating a PDF of ODF format
  report.
- Always open to suggestions on how to improve this report and of course bugs
  that people find as well.
