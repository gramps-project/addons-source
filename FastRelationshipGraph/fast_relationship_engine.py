"""Fast relationship search, as a standalone addon -- no core patching.

This module does not modify `gramps.gen.relationship.RelationshipCalculator`
or any other core class in any way: nothing here mutates a class or
instance that already exists elsewhere in the running process. Instead,
`fast_calculator_class()` synthesizes a brand-new class per locale, on
demand, via ordinary Python multiple inheritance: `FastRelationshipMixin`
(this module) placed *before* whatever locale-specific calculator class
`gramps.gen.relationship.get_relationship_calculator()` would itself have
returned. Python's normal method-resolution order gives this mixin's
methods priority for exactly the ones it defines (the search:
`__apply_filter`, `get_relationship_distance_new`, and their two small
helpers) while every other method -- all locale-specific wording, all 23
languages' worth -- falls through untouched to the real calculator class
being mixed in. No class or instance outside of what this function
constructs and returns is ever touched.

The methods below are a verbatim copy of the same fix submitted upstream
as https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps/pull/2526 (see that PR's
description for the full writeup: three compounding performance bugs in
`RelationshipCalculator`'s search, each one exposed as the new bottleneck
once the previous one was fixed, together making relationship lookups
exponential under pedigree collapse -- measured 40% of random lookups
failing to complete within 20 seconds on a real 100,000-person tree,
0% after). This addon exists so the fix is usable immediately, independent
of that PR's own merge timeline, and does not depend on it merging at all.

Because these are the *exact same* methods (not a reimplementation), they
carry the exact same correctness guarantees already validated there: byte-
identical `pmap` output on a 10,000-comparison parity suite against the
original algorithm, correct behavior across `en`/`de`/`it`/`ru` locales,
and the same explicitly-out-of-scope limitation (a person with more than
one recorded parent family is not accelerated -- see that PR's description
for why, and what it would take to fix).

        This is a safe reduction of the input to `get_relationship_distance_new`'s

        if some path B is properly prefixed by another path A to the same

        Typically this method is called recursively in two ways:
        First method is stoprecursemap= None
        In this case a recursemap is builded by storing all data.

        Second method is with a stoprecursemap given
        In this case parents are recursively looked up. If present in
        stoprecursemap, a common ancestor is found, and the method can
        stop looking further. If however self.__crosslinks == True, the data
        of first contains loops, and parents
        will be looked up anyway an stored if common. At end the doubles
        are filtered out

        `memo` is per-outermost-call state: a person's set of reachable
        ancestors (and any siblings injected along the way -- see the
        "family without parents" case below) is memoized the first time
        it is fully derived from the database, and replayed from memory
        on a later revisit within the same outermost call instead of
        being re-derived. Without this, a person reached a second time
        via a different branch (pedigree collapse, or simply a large
        tree) triggers a full second walk of everything above them,
        which is what makes this method exponential in the number of
        such revisits. Callers never pass `memo` explicitly; it is
        created fresh on the outermost call and threaded through the
