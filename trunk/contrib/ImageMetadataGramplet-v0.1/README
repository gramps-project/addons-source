*******

Welcome to imageMetadataGramplet.py.  By using pyexiv2-0.1.3, python binding library to exiv2,
created by Olivier Tilloy, you are able to read, write, and edit the Exif Image Metadata stored 
within image files...

Available languages at the time of this compressed file are:
------------------------------------------------------------
fr, nl, and sv

Fedora, Ubuntu/ Debian, Windows
_______________________________
You may get this python library from: http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/

Point your browser to http://exiv2.org/metadata.html for the complete metadata
tag reference.

Build dependencies
==================

pyexiv2 depends on the following libraries:

 * boost.python (http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/index.html)
 * exiv2 (http://www.exiv2.org/)

It uses SCons (http://www.scons.org/) as a build system.

Some examples in src/ use PyGTK (http://www.pygtk.org/) and PyQt
(http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/) to display image previews,
those are optional dependencies.

Fedora 13
_________
This is a typical list of build dependencies for a Fedora 13 system:

* python-2.6.4, and python-devel-2.6.4
* scons
* exiv2-0.19, and exiv2-devel-0.19
* expat, and expat-devel
* boost-python-1.41 or greater

Ubuntu/ Debian
______________
This is a typical list of build dependencies for a Debian/Ubuntu system:

 * python-all-dev
 * scons
 * libexiv2-dev (>= 0.18)
 * libboost-python-dev


Building and installing
=======================

To build and install the library, while in the top-level directory
(e.g. '~/dev/pyexiv2', which should contain a file named 'SConstruct'),
run the following commands:

 $ scons
 $ scons install # as administrator, e.g. `sudo scons install`

The result of the build is a dynamic library, libexiv2python.so, in the build/
directory. This is the low-level binding. It is in turn used in a higher level
module, pyexiv2.
The install command installs the two modules in your site-specific directory for
Python modules (e.g. '/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/' on Linux).

SPECIAL NOTE
____________
You will need to cp the pyexiv2/src/pyexiv2.py file to your typical python site-packages directory:

cp -a pyexiv2.py /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/

AS PYTHON3.1 is on the quick rise to replace python2, you would need to:
cp -a pyexiv2.py /usr/lib/python3.1/site-packages

To use pyexiv2 in your scripts, simply import the pyexiv2 module.

Documentation
=============

Please refer to the internal documentation for a guide on how to use pyexiv2.
In a python interpreter, type:

 >>> import pyexiv2
 >>> help(pyexiv2)

Alternatively, you can generate HTML documentation using python's built-in
module, pydoc:

 $ cd doc/
 $ pydoc -w ../src/pyexiv2/*.py

Or using the more complete tool epydoc (http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/):

 $ epydoc --html -o doc src/pyexiv2/*.py
